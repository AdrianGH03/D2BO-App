# D2BO

Hello, welcome to D2BO 👋

D2BO is an Web app that allows players in Destiny 2
to organize their bounties in an efficient manner.

What this means is that players will be able to see which bounties
occur the most throughout their bounty inventory, allowing them
to know which bounties to target while playing Destiny 2.

Targeting the most bounties in order to complete them helps players
obtain things such as seasonal artifact XP, bright dust, season pass XP,
and many other bounty rewards much faster!

Why? 
- While playing Destiny 2, I was tired of having to constantly open my inventory to see
  what bounties I needed to complete and what objectives I needed to do. Categorizing the bounties
  to know the most amount of bounties I can knock out is the aim of D2BO. To effectively knock out the most
  bounties, all I would need to do is focus on the sub-categories with the most amount of bounties.
  BAM! Easy season pass XP and less time wasted.
